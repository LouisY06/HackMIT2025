### Accessing AI Features

- **Store AI Insights**: Navigate to `/store/ai-insights` from store dashboard
- **Volunteer AI Insights**: Navigate to `/volunteer/ai-insights` from volunteer dashboard
- **Global AI Impact**: Navigate to `/global-ai-impact` for platform-wide analytics

## üìä AI Features

### 1. Weekly AI-Generated Reports

**Inputs:**
- Store-uploaded food waste logs (type, weight, value)
- Volunteer pickup scans (QR code confirmations)
- Distribution center confirmations

**Processing:**
- AI model aggregates 7 days of data
- Identifies waste trends by store, food type, time of day
- Estimates financial loss (retail value of wasted goods)
- Calculates carbon footprint impact

**Outputs:**
- Daily waste breakdown (e.g., 12kg bread, 5kg produce, 2kg meat)
- Net profit loss per store/week
- Carbon footprint avoided vs actual
- Heatmap of high-waste stores

### 2. Predictive AI Suggestions

**Inventory Forecasting:**
- Predicts next week's likely waste per food category
- Recommends reduced ordering amounts for high-waste items
- Auto-alerts for waste reduction opportunities

**Volunteer Optimization:**
- Learns which volunteers pick up fastest
- Suggests optimized matching (right volunteer for right store)
- Personalized efficiency recommendations

**Food Bank Demand Matching:**
- Predicts which food banks need which items
- Auto-suggests distribution routes to minimize storage loss

### 3. AI-Enhanced User Experience

**Store Dashboard:**
- Weekly "AI Insights" tab with suggested order quantities
- Auto-alert: "You threw away 20kg lettuce last week. Reduce order by 15% next cycle."
- Performance scoring and optimization tips

**Volunteer Dashboard:**
- Personalized badges for "most efficient pickups"
- Suggested times/locations for volunteering
- Achievement progress tracking

**Food Bank Dashboard:**
- Predicts incoming donation type/quantity
- Helps plan staffing and storage capacity

## üîß API Endpoints

### AI Analytics Endpoints

- `POST /api/ai/weekly-report` - Generate comprehensive weekly AI report
- `GET /api/ai/store-insights/{store_email}` - Get AI insights for specific store
- `GET /api/ai/global-metrics` - Get platform-wide AI metrics
- `GET /api/ai/heatmap-data` - Get waste heatmap data for visualization

### Example API Usage

```javascript
// Get store AI insights
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/store-insights/store@example.com?days=30');
const data = await response.json();

// Generate weekly report
const reportResponse = await fetch('/api/ai/weekly-report', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ store_email: 'store@example.com', days: 7 })
});
```
